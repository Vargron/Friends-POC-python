This is a prototype analog to facebook's friends system as a projects for a class using the python django framework.
users are able to log in and register(with validations), add users to their friends and remove friends from other users.
they can also view each user's profile(primarily a holding object for more detail in a potential later iteration)
the app will also hold the user's login in session and redirect the user either to thier friend manager or the login screen depending on status. 

let me know if you have any questions.
